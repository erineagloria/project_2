### GA SEI Project 2: Building my first Full-Stack Application
### loopd | Client Event Engine

## Project Description: 

Visit <a href="https://boiling-temple-92123.herokuapp.com/">loopd</a>

I've built a client event directory targeted for a business's existing clients who want to keep track of all the events they have hosted with us over the years. I've leaned into my events and sales experience to create this app. Even though a company may have hosted events with us in the past, the main contact/event organiser may have changed resulting in a loss of valuable information and feedback. 

### Technologies used:
* Whimsical (used to make the wireframe)
* Trello (used to make to-do lists)
* HTML5
* CSS
* Ruby
* PostgreSQL
* Sinatra
* Heroku (to host my website)
* BCrypt (password encryption)

### App Features:
*Please see attached wireframes for initial design and order of tasks.**

loopd is built for existing clients. Upon loading the website the user will be asked to enter their login details(company name & password) right away.

Below the login details there is a feed of previous events that have taken place for inspiration. When the images are when clicked it will give a few event details. The client will be anonymous of course!


Upon logging in, the user will have access to their dashboard with a record of events listed in order with the latest/upcoming events at the top. Clients can update upcoming events and also submit a request to host another event with us. Clients can also add notes to previous events; however, all other details will be locked.

The app will allow them to draw inspiration from other clients' events and keep a record of their events with our business. 

### Improvements:
* Add hover features to the nav bar.
* Re-adjust the input fields so they all align.
* Add a 'Business Administrator account' to create new users (companies) and close accounts. 
* Add a feature for clients to like/comment other client's events.
