### GA SEI Project 2: Building my first Full-Stack Application
### Project Title: EventEngine/Homecoming

### Project Description: 
1 paragraph of what I've built...
I've leaned in to my events and sales experience to find a solution to a common problem I used to run into with return clients who overtime have different contacts/event organisers. I've built a client event directory targeted towards a business's return clients who want to keep track of all the events they have hosted with us over the years. It will highlight basic info (event name, venue, theme, date(or just month and year), number of guests, total budget, hero image, sales manager). 

The home page will be simple. There will be a login feature and inspiration images of past events. When the images are when clicked it will give a few event details such as venue, number of guests, theme, month & year, (client will be anonymous of course!)

When the client logs in there will be a record of their event history with our business. Previous events will be locked, but they can make updates to upcoming events (such as theme, number of guests, budget).

When logged in they will also be able to like and comment other images, and upload their own images to their account (bonus feature, if I have time!)

The app will allow them to draw inspiration from other clients previous events (also a great sales tool) and keep a record of their events with our business. 

Target audience: Existing clients (when a client books an event with our business, they will be added to the network)
